Mutual divorce, also known as mutual consent divorce, is a legal process where both spouses jointly agree to end their marriage. It is the most peaceful, fastest, and least expensive form of divorce because there is no dispute between the parties.

Since both partners agree on separation and settlement terms, mutual divorce avoids prolonged litigation, reduces emotional stress, and ensures a smoother legal process.

## Key Features of Mutual Divorce

### Mutual Agreement

Both spouses voluntarily consent to dissolve the marriage and jointly file a petition before the competent Family Court.

### Minimal Conflict

Mutual divorce does not involve allegations such as:

- Cruelty  
- Adultery  
- Desertion  
- Harassment  

This makes the process amicable and respectful.

### Settlement Terms Finalized Before Filing

Both parties must mutually agree on important matters, including:

- Child custody  
- Alimony or maintenance  
- Division of property and assets  
- Visitation rights  

These terms are recorded before the divorce is granted.

### Cooling-off Period

There is usually a 6-month cooling-off period between the first and second motion. This period allows spouses to reconsider their decision.

However, courts may waive this period in appropriate cases where reconciliation is not possible.

### Faster Proceedings

After the cooling-off period, and once both parties reaffirm consent, the court grants the divorce decree.

The entire process typically takes between 6 months to 1 year, depending on the court and case circumstances.

## Advantages of Mutual Divorce

Mutual divorce offers several benefits:

- Quick resolution  
- Lower legal costs  
- Less emotional stress  
- Greater privacy  
- Higher chance of compliance with settlement terms  
- Predictable and mutually agreed outcome  

It allows both spouses to separate peacefully and move forward with their lives.
