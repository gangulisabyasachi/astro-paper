Mutual divorce, also known as mutual consent divorce, is a legal process where both spouses agree to end their marriage peacefully. It is the simplest, fastest, and least stressful way to dissolve a marriage because there is no dispute between the parties.

Unlike contested divorce, mutual divorce avoids prolonged litigation and helps both spouses move forward with clarity and dignity.

## Key Features of Mutual Consent Divorce

### Mutual Agreement

Both spouses voluntarily agree to dissolve the marriage and jointly file the divorce petition before the court.

### Minimal Conflict

There are no allegations such as:

- Cruelty  
- Adultery  
- Desertion  
- Harassment  

This makes the process respectful and cooperative.

### Settlement Terms Are Finalized Before Filing

Both parties must agree on important matters such as:

- Child custody  
- Alimony or maintenance  
- Division of property and assets  
- Visitation rights  

The court records these terms before granting divorce.

### Cooling-off Period

Typically, there is a 6-month cooling-off period between the first and second motion.

This period allows spouses time to reconsider their decision.

However, courts may waive this period in appropriate cases where reconciliation is not possible.

### Faster Legal Proceedings

Once both parties reaffirm their consent after the cooling-off period, the court grants the divorce decree.

The entire process usually takes 6 months to 1 year, depending on the case and court workload.

## Advantages of Mutual Divorce

Mutual divorce offers several important benefits:

- Faster resolution compared to contested divorce  
- Lower legal costs  
- Less emotional stress  
- Greater privacy  
- Predictable outcome  
- Higher compliance with agreed settlement
