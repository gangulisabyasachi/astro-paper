  Can secretly recorded conversations between husband and wife be used as evidence in divorce proceedings? The Supreme Court of India has ruled yes — subject to safeguards. This landmark judgment balances marital privacy (Article 21) against the right to a fair trial, clarifies Section 122 of the Evidence Act, and gives procedural guidance for Family Courts.

“In a decision weighing marital privacy against the pursuit of truth in court, the Supreme Court has ruled that sometimes, the quest for justice in a broken marriage requires listening to what was never meant to be heard.”

In a significant ruling delivered by Justices **B.V. Nagarathna** and **Satish Chandra Sharma**, the Supreme Court of India has held that **covert audio recordings** between spouses can be admitted as evidence in matrimonial disputes — subject to strict procedural safeguards.

The judgment directly addresses a recurring and contentious question in modern divorce litigation:

> Can secretly recorded conversations between husband and wife be used as evidence in court?

## Table of contents

## Background of the Case

The dispute originated in a divorce petition filed by the husband on the ground of cruelty. During the trial, the husband sought to produce:

- A supplementary affidavit
- Audio recordings stored on memory cards and CDs
- Conversations between himself and his wife secretly recorded in 2010 and 2016

The Family Court permitted the recordings, invoking its wide powers under the **Family Courts Act, 1984** to consider any relevant material that would assist in just resolution of matrimonial disputes.

The wife challenged this before the High Court, which reversed the order, holding that admitting such secretly obtained recordings violated her **right to privacy** under **Article 21** of the Constitution.

The matter reached the Supreme Court on appeal.

## Supreme Court’s Interim Safeguards

While allowing the recordings to be considered, the Supreme Court issued clear procedural directions to protect privacy:

- Evidence and cross-examination relating to the recordings shall be conducted **in-camera**
- Transcripts of the recordings shall be kept in a **sealed cover**
- The Court appointed Senior Advocate **Vrinda Grover** as amicus curiae to assist in examining conflicting High Court views on the admissibility of covert recordings in matrimonial cases

## Key Legal Issues Examined

### 1. Are Secretly Recorded Conversations Automatically Inadmissible?

**No**, ruled the Supreme Court.

Relying on long-standing precedents including:

- *Yusufalli Esmail Nagree v. State of Maharashtra*
- *R.M. Malkani v. State of Maharashtra*

The Court reaffirmed that evidence obtained illegally or without consent is **not automatically inadmissible** in civil proceedings — particularly in matrimonial disputes — if it satisfies basic reliability tests.

### Three-Fold Test for Admissibility

The Court laid down that covert recordings must meet these conditions:

1. **Relevance** — The content must directly relate to the issues in the divorce case (e.g., cruelty, desertion)
2. **Identification** — The voices of the speakers must be clearly identifiable
3. **Authenticity and Accuracy** — The recording must be genuine, continuous, and free from tampering

Absence of consent does **not** by itself render the recording inadmissible, provided it was made voluntarily and without coercion or inducement.

### 2. Section 122 of the Indian Evidence Act — Spousal Privilege

The Court closely examined **Section 122** of the Evidence Act, 1872, which protects communications made between spouses during marriage.

Key clarifications:

- Section 122 prevents a spouse from being **compelled** to disclose confidential communications made **to** them during marriage
- However, there is an explicit exception: the bar **does not apply** in suits or proceedings **between married persons** (including divorce and judicial separation cases)
- The privilege protects communications **made to** a spouse — not necessarily communications **made by** them
- Importantly, the exception allows independent proof of such communications (e.g., through recordings made by one party)

Thus, in divorce proceedings, Section 122 does **not** create an absolute bar.

### 3. Privacy (Article 21) vs Right to Fair Trial

The wife invoked her fundamental right to privacy under **Article 21**.

The Supreme Court acknowledged that privacy is a fundamental right but held that:

- The right to privacy is **not absolute**
- It must be balanced against the **right to a fair trial** and access to justice
- In matrimonial litigation, evidence is often intensely personal and limited to the spouses themselves
- Excluding relevant evidence solely on privacy grounds could defeat the ends of justice

The Court observed:

> “Snooping may be a symptom of marital breakdown, not its cause. Admitting such evidence does not encourage surveillance — it merely ensures that relevant evidence is not shut out.”

## Role of the Family Courts Act, 1984

Under **Section 14** of the Family Courts Act, Family Courts are empowered to receive any evidence that appears relevant — even if it would be inadmissible under strict rules of evidence in civil courts.

This statutory flexibility strongly supported admission of the recordings in a matrimonial context.

## Guidance Suggested by the Amicus Curiae

Senior Advocate Vrinda Grover, as amicus, proposed several factors courts should consider when exercising discretion over covert recordings:

- Temporal and factual proximity of the recording to the matrimonial dispute
- Intention behind producing the recording (genuine proof vs harassment)
- Proportionality — was the recording the least intrusive method available?
- Socioeconomic power imbalance between the spouses
- Risk of tampering and burden on forensic facilities

These guidelines are likely to influence future decisions across Family Courts in India, including Kolkata.

## Final Verdict

The Supreme Court:

- Set aside the High Court’s order excluding the recordings
- Restored the Family Court’s decision to admit them
- Directed in-camera proceedings and sealed-cover transcripts to safeguard privacy

## Why This Judgment Is Important

This ruling is a landmark in Indian matrimonial and evidence law because it:

- Clearly permits **secret recordings between spouses** as evidence in divorce cases (subject to safeguards)
- Clarifies that **Section 122 Evidence Act** contains a built-in exception for matrimonial proceedings
- Establishes that the right to privacy under Article 21 does **not** automatically override the right to prove cruelty or other matrimonial misconduct
- Reinforces the **wide evidentiary discretion** of Family Courts under the Family Courts Act
- Provides practical procedural safeguards to prevent misuse

As matrimonial disputes increasingly involve digital and electronic evidence, this judgment sets a clear precedent for the admissibility of covert recordings, the interpretation of spousal privilege, and the balancing of privacy against fair trial rights.

## Conclusion

The Supreme Court has struck a careful balance: protecting marital confidence where possible, while ensuring that no relevant evidence is excluded when a marriage has irretrievably broken down and justice demands its consideration.

For litigants and lawyers in Kolkata and across India, this ruling provides much-needed clarity on one of the most debated evidentiary issues in modern divorce litigation.
